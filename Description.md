# ðŸ¤–Data Cleaning Automation | E-Learning
We are data analysts and we want to analyze the job market in these roles. To do this, we are obtaining data from the jobs listed on LinkedIn in areas of data analysis for different countries.

We want to conclude the job market from the world of data. For this, we have information about a download of web scrapping data that we have obtained. We have to validate if the data is correct and then reach certain conclusions.

The first step is to clean the data and create new tables with the clean data. The second step will be to automate this cleaning with an SP that runs daily and updates the information in the new table.
