# ðŸ¤–Data Cleaning Automation | E-Learning
In this project, we analyze the data of an ecommerce company that is dedicated to selling physical products online. We answered different business questions, both financial and marketing.

We are data analysts and we want to analyze the labor market in these roles. For this we are obtaining data from the jobs listed on LinkedIn in areas of data analysis for different countries.

We want to draw conclusions about the labor market from the world of data. For this we have information about a download of webscrapping data that we have obtained and we have to first validate if the data is correct and then reach certain conclusions.

The first step is to clean the data and create new tables with the clean data. The second step will be to automate this cleaning with an SP that runs daily and updates the information in the new table.
